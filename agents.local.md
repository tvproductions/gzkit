# Local Agent Rules

- Order versioned identifiers semantically, never lexicographically. Example: `ADR-0.9.0` comes before `ADR-0.10.0`.
- Apply semantic-version ordering in ADR summaries, comparisons, and any operator-facing status narration.
- When adding imports in an Edit call, always include the code that uses them in the same edit. The post-edit ruff hook removes unused imports immediately — splitting import addition and usage across separate edits causes the import to be deleted before it's referenced.
- Always prefix `uv run gz` and `uv run -m gzkit` Bash commands with `PYTHONUTF8=1` on Windows. Rich console output contains Unicode characters (checkmarks, arrows, warning signs) that fail with `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows legacy console (cp1252). Example: `PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run gz gates --adr ADR-0.1.0`.

## Architectural Boundaries

*Source: Architecture Planning Memo Section 12 (Decision Record 2026-03-29).*

1. **Do not promote post-1.0 pool ADRs into active work.** `ai-runtime-foundations`, `controlled-agency-recovery`, and `evaluation-infrastructure` (the pool version) are post-1.0 concerns. The graph spine, proof architecture, and pipeline lifecycle are not stable enough to support AI runtime controls on top.
2. **Do not add more pool ADRs to the runtime track.** The pool has sufficient architectural intent for 2-3 years of work. The problem is insufficient foundation locking, not insufficient vision.
3. **Do not build the graph engine without locking state doctrine first.** A graph engine built on implicit state assumptions becomes the single biggest source of reconciliation bugs.
4. **Do not let reconciliation remain a maintenance chore.** If the state doctrine says "derived state is rebuildable," then reconciliation is a core architectural operation — tested, gated, and part of the pipeline.
5. **Do not let AirlineOps parity become perpetual catch-up.** Current parity is sufficient baseline. Future parity should flow from gzkit innovations adopted by AirlineOps, not gzkit chasing AirlineOps patches.
6. **Do not let derived views silently become source-of-truth.** `gz status` output, pipeline markers, and reconciliation caches are Layer 3. Every fact must trace to Layer 1 (canon) or Layer 2 (ledger).
