# gz-obpi-lock

Claim or release OBPI-level work locks for multi-agent coordination.

### Common Rationalizations

These thoughts mean STOP — you are about to bypass coordination:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "No one else is working on this, I don't need to lock" | You do not know what other agents are doing. The lock is coordination, not permission. |
| "I'll just do a quick fix, no need for a lock" | Quick fixes that conflict with another agent's work create merge conflicts. Lock first, always. |
| "The lock expired, so I'll just re-claim it" | An expired lock may mean another agent started work. Check status before re-claiming. |
| "I'll release the lock manually later" | The pipeline releases at Stage 5. Manual release outside the pipeline risks orphaned work. |
| "Lock conflicts slow me down" | Merge conflict resolution after concurrent edits is far slower than waiting for a lock. |

### Red Flags

- Multiple agents editing the same ADR's files without lock coordination
- Lock file exists but agent proceeds without checking it
- Pipeline completes but lock is never released (orphaned lock)
- Agent force-releases another agent's lock without investigating
- Work begins on an OBPI without any `gz obpi lock claim` in the session

---

## When to Use

- Before starting work on an OBPI (claim it)
- After completing or abandoning OBPI work (release it)
- To check which OBPIs are currently claimed by agents

---

## Invocation

```text
/gz-obpi-lock claim OBPI-0.0.25-03
/gz-obpi-lock release OBPI-0.0.25-03
/gz-obpi-lock status                    # show all locks
/gz-obpi-lock status ADR-0.0.25        # show locks for one ADR
```

---

## Lock Mechanism

**File-based locks** in `.gzkit/locks/` (gitignored — local coordination only).

### Lock File Format

Path: `.gzkit/locks/obpi/{OBPI-ID}.lock.json`

```json
{
  "obpi_id": "OBPI-0.0.25-03",
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "pid": 12345,
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "claimed_at": "2026-02-14T12:00:00Z",
  "branch": "master",
  "ttl_minutes": 120
}
```

### Lock Rules

1. **Claim succeeds** if no lock file exists or existing lock is expired (past TTL)
2. **Claim fails** if lock exists and is not expired — show who holds it
3. **Release** deletes the lock file
4. **Stale lock detection** — locks older than TTL are automatically released on next claim attempt
5. **Same-agent re-claim** — if the claiming agent already holds the lock, refresh the timestamp
6. **Exception mode concurrent locks** — When the parent ADR has `## Execution Mode: Exception (SVFR)`, multiple OBPIs from the same ADR can be locked concurrently by different agents. In Normal mode, only one OBPI lock per ADR at a time

---

## Procedure

### Claim

```bash
uv run gz obpi lock claim OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN
uv run gz obpi lock claim OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN --ttl 240
uv run gz obpi lock claim OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN --json
```

Exit code 0 = claimed, 1 = conflict (another agent holds it).

### Release

```bash
uv run gz obpi lock release OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN
uv run gz obpi lock release OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN --json
uv run gz obpi lock release OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN --force   # abort/handoff — bypass ownership check
```

Exit code 0 = released (or no lock found), 1 = ownership error (without `--force`).

### Check (single OBPI)

```bash
uv run gz obpi lock check OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN
uv run gz obpi lock check OBPI-X.Y.Z-NN --json
```

Exit code 0 = held (prints holder info), 1 = free.

### List (all locks)

```bash
uv run gz obpi lock list
uv run gz obpi lock list --adr ADR-X.Y.Z
uv run gz obpi lock list --json
```

## Agent Identity

Agents identify themselves by environment:

| Signal | Agent |
|--------|-------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE` env var or Claude Code runtime | `claude-code` |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX` env var | `codex` |
| VS Code Copilot context | `copilot` |
| Fallback | `unknown-{PID}` |

---

## Integration with Pipeline

The pipeline calls `uv run gz obpi lock claim` at Stage 1 (Load Context) and `uv run gz obpi lock release` at Stage 5 (Sync). On any abort or handoff, the pipeline releases the lock via `uv run gz obpi lock release {OBPI-SLUG} --force` to prevent orphaned locks.

---

## Conflict Detection

### Shared File Registry

Files known to cause multi-agent conflicts:

| File Pattern | Conflict Type | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| `docs/design/adr/*/adr_status.md` | ADR status table | Regenerate via `/gz-adr-sync` |
| `**/logs/obpi-audit.jsonl` | Append-only ledger | JSONL merge driver (see below) |
| `docs/design/adr/**/*.md` (status field) | Brief status | Lock prevents concurrent edits |
| `.gzkit/insights/agent-insights.jsonl` | Append-only log | JSONL merge driver |

### JSONL Merge Strategy

For append-only JSONL files, conflicts are resolvable by union merge:

1. Parse both sides as line arrays
2. Union (deduplicate by timestamp + content hash)
3. Sort by timestamp ascending
4. Write merged result

Add to `.gitattributes`:

```gitattributes
*.jsonl merge=union
```

The `merge=union` strategy keeps lines from both sides, which is correct for append-only ledgers.

### Pre-Push Conflict Check

Before pushing, agents should verify no divergence on shared files:

```bash
# Check if shared governance files have diverged from remote
git fetch origin
git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | grep -E '(adr_status|obpi-audit\.jsonl|agent-insights\.jsonl)'
```

If shared files appear in the diff, the agent should:
1. Pull and rebase
2. Regenerate computed files (`/gz-adr-sync`, `/gz-obpi-reconcile`)
3. Re-push

---

## Worktree Isolation (Advanced)

For heavy parallel workloads, each agent can use a separate git worktree:

```bash
# Create agent-specific worktree
git worktree add ../gzkit-claude-code -b agent/claude-code/obpi-0.0.25-03

# Work in the worktree
cd ../gzkit-claude-code

# Merge back
cd ../gzkit
git merge agent/claude-code/obpi-0.0.25-03
git worktree remove ../gzkit-claude-code
```

**When to use worktrees:**
- 2+ agents working on the same ADR simultaneously
- OBPIs with overlapping file paths
- Long-running implementation sessions (>2 hours)

**When NOT to use worktrees:**
- Single agent sessions (unnecessary overhead)
- Quick fixes or single-OBPI work
- OBPIs with non-overlapping paths
