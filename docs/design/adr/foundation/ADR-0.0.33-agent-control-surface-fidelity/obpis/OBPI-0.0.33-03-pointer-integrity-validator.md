# OBPI-0.0.33-03-pointer-integrity-validator: Pointer Integrity Validator

## ADR Item

- **Source ADR:** `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity.md`
- **Checklist Item:** #3 - "OBPI-0.0.33-03: Pointer-integrity validator (`gz validate --pointer-anchors`) — parse `> See [...]` blockquotes, resolve anchors, reverse-check `<!-- lifted-from: -->` back-pointers, exit 3 on unresolved"

**Status:** Draft

## Objective

<!-- One-sentence concrete outcome. What does "done" look like? -->

Pointer-integrity validator (`gz validate --pointer-anchors`) — parse `> See [...]` blockquotes, resolve anchors, reverse-check `<!-- lifted-from: -->` back-pointers, exit 3 on unresolved.

## Lane

**Heavy** - This OBPI changes a command/API/schema/runtime contract surface.

> Heavy is reserved for command/API/schema/runtime-contract changes. Process,
> documentation, and template-only work stays Lite unless it changes one of
> those external surfaces.

## Allowed Paths

<!-- What files/directories are IN SCOPE? Be explicit with paths. -->

- `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity.md` — parent ADR for intent and scope
- `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/**` — parent ADR package scope

## Denied Paths

<!-- What files/directories are OUT OF SCOPE? Agents will not touch these. -->

- Paths not listed in Allowed Paths
- New dependencies
- CI files, lockfiles

## Requirements (FAIL-CLOSED)

<!-- Constraints that MUST hold. Numbered list. NEVER/ALWAYS language.
     These are the rules agents ground against. If not met, OBPI fails. -->

1. REQUIREMENT: **Bullet retention** — every bullet on `docs/governance/advisory-rules-audit.md`
1. REQUIREMENT: **Surface weight regression** — direction-binding (no growth past current
1. REQUIREMENT: **Pointer integrity** — every `> See [...](path#anchor)` lift pointer in
1. REQUIREMENT: **Loading-scenario reachability** — every Mechanical/Promotable bullet is

> STOP-on-BLOCKERS: if prerequisites are missing, print a BLOCKERS list and halt.

## Discovery Checklist

<!-- What to read before implementation. Complete this checklist first.
     Order matters: read the structured input (parent ADR § Decision)
     before the unstructured one (allowed paths, prerequisites). -->

**Parent ADR (read first; order pinned — GHI #321):**

- [ ] **Parent ADR § Decision item — quote the line this OBPI implements** verbatim into the brief's Implementation Summary. The Decision item is the contract; everything else hangs off it.
- [ ] Parent ADR § Intent — the why-frame for the Decision read above.
- [ ] Parent ADR file: `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity.md`

> **STOP:** If you cannot quote the parent ADR § Decision item that this OBPI implements, STOP and re-read. Do not proceed to Allowed Paths, Prerequisites, or implementation until the Decision quote is in hand.

**Governance (read once, cache):**

- [ ] `.github/discovery-index.json` - repo structure
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` - agent operating contract

**Context:**

- [ ] Related OBPIs in same ADR

**Prerequisites (check existence, STOP if missing):**

- [ ] Required path exists or is intentionally created in this OBPI: `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity.md`
- [ ] Required path exists or is intentionally created in this OBPI: `docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/**`
- [ ] Parent ADR evidence artifacts referenced by this brief are present

**Existing Code (understand current state):**

- [ ] Existing tests adjacent to the Allowed Paths reviewed before implementation
- [ ] Parent ADR integration points reviewed for local conventions

## Quality Gates

<!-- Which gates apply and how to verify them. -->

### Gate 1: ADR

- [ ] Intent and scope recorded in this OBPI brief
- [ ] Parent ADR checklist item quoted

### Gate 2: TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] Tests derived from brief acceptance criteria, not from implementation
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed per behavior increment
- [ ] Tests pass: `uv run gz test`
- [ ] Validation commands recorded in evidence with real outputs

### Code Quality

- [ ] Lint clean: `uv run gz lint`
- [ ] Type check clean: `uv run gz typecheck`

<!-- Heavy lane only: -->
### Gate 3: Docs (Heavy only)

- [ ] Docs build: `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
- [ ] Relevant docs updated

### Gate 4: BDD (Heavy only)

- [ ] Acceptance scenarios pass: `uv run -m behave features/`

### Gate 5: Human (Heavy only)

- [ ] Human attestation recorded

## Verification

<!-- What commands verify this work? Use real repo commands, then paste the
     outputs into Evidence. -->

```bash
uv run gz validate --documents
uv run gz lint
uv run gz typecheck
uv run gz test

# Specific verification for this OBPI
test -f docs/design/adr/foundation/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity/ADR-0.0.33-agent-control-surface-fidelity.md
```

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Specific, testable criteria for completion.
Each checkbox MUST carry a deterministic REQ ID:
REQ-<semver>-<obpi_item>-<criterion_index>
-->

- [ ] REQ-0.0.33-03-01: Given the parent ADR intent, when the OBPI implementation is complete, then the primary scoped artifacts exist and match the documented contract
- [ ] REQ-0.0.33-03-02: Given the Allowed Paths in this brief, when the OBPI is executed, then changes remain inside scope and denied paths remain untouched
- [ ] REQ-0.0.33-03-03: Given the Verification commands in this brief, when they run, then evidence is recorded before the OBPI is accepted

## Completion Checklist

<!-- Verify all gates before marking OBPI accepted. -->

- [ ] **Gate 1 (ADR):** Intent recorded in brief
- [ ] **Gate 2 (TDD):** RGR cycle followed, tests derived from brief, coverage maintained
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Lint, format, type checks clean
- [ ] **Value Narrative:** Problem-before vs capability-now is documented
- [ ] **Key Proof:** One concrete usage example is included
- [ ] **OBPI Acceptance:** Evidence recorded below

> For ceremony steps and lane-inheritance attestation rules, see `AGENTS.md` section `OBPI Acceptance Protocol`.

## Evidence
