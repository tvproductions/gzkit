## Gate Covenant

Follow the gzkit gate covenant for all changes:

| Gate | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| Gate 1 | ADR recorded | `gz validate` |
| Gate 2 | Tests pass | `gz test` |
| Gate 3 | Docs updated | `gz lint` |
| Gate 4 | BDD verified | Manual |
| Gate 5 | Human attests | `gz attest` |

## Governance Workflow

1. Check state: `gz state`
2. Check status: `gz status`
3. Create ADR for changes: `gz plan`
4. Implement with tests
5. Validate: `gz validate && gz check`
6. Request attestation: Human runs `gz attest`

## Control Surfaces

This file is generated by `gz sync` from governance canon.
