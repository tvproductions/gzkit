# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with {project_name}.

## Project Overview

{project_purpose}

## Canonical Contract

`AGENTS.md` is the authoritative governance contract.

If this file and `AGENTS.md` diverge, follow `AGENTS.md` and run `gz agent sync control-surfaces`.

## Tech Stack

{tech_stack}

## Build Commands

```bash
{build_commands}
```

## Architecture

{architecture}

## Coding Conventions

{coding_conventions}

## Key Invariants

## Gate Covenant

Follow the gzkit gate covenant for all changes:

| Gate | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| Gate 1 | ADR recorded | `gz validate --documents` |
| Gate 2 | Tests pass | `gz test` |
| Gate 3 | Docs updated | `gz lint` |
| Gate 4 | BDD verified | Manual |
| Gate 5 | Human attests | `gz attest` |

## Governance Workflow

1. Check state: `gz state`
2. Check status: `gz status`
3. Create ADR for changes: `gz plan`
4. Implement with tests
5. Validate: `gz validate --documents && gz check`
6. Request attestation: Human runs `gz attest`

## OBPI Acceptance

OBPI closure follows `AGENTS.md` and is attestation-first:

1. Present value narrative
2. Present key proof
3. Present verification evidence
4. Wait for explicit human acceptance
5. Only then mark brief status `Completed`

Reference: `AGENTS.md` section `OBPI Acceptance Protocol`.

## Skills

Skills are centralized under `.gzkit` and mirrored to tool-local paths:

- Canonical skills: `{skills_canon_path}`
- Claude skill mirror: `{skills_claude_path}`
- Codex skill mirror: `{skills_codex_path}`
- Copilot skill mirror: `{skills_copilot_path}`

## Control Surfaces

This file is generated by `gz agent sync control-surfaces` from governance canon.

Project-specific additions come from `agents.local.md`.
