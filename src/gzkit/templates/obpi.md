# {id}: {title}

## ADR Item

- **Source ADR:** `{parent_adr_path}`
- **Checklist Item:** #{item_number} - "{checklist_item_text}"

**Status:** Draft

## Objective

<!-- One-sentence concrete outcome. What does "done" look like? -->

{objective}

## Lane

**{lane}** - {lane_rationale}

> Heavy is reserved for command/API/schema/runtime-contract changes. Process,
> documentation, and template-only work stays Lite unless it changes one of
> those external surfaces.

## Allowed Paths

<!-- What files/directories are IN SCOPE? Be explicit with paths. -->

{allowed_paths_md}

## Denied Paths

<!-- What files/directories are OUT OF SCOPE? Agents will not touch these. -->

{denied_paths_md}

## Requirements (FAIL-CLOSED)

<!-- Constraints that MUST hold. Numbered list. NEVER/ALWAYS language.
     These are the rules agents ground against. If not met, OBPI fails. -->

{requirements_md}

> STOP-on-BLOCKERS: if prerequisites are missing, print a BLOCKERS list and halt.

## Discovery Checklist

<!-- What to read before implementation. Complete this checklist first. -->

**Governance (read once, cache):**

- [ ] `.github/discovery-index.json` - repo structure
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` - agent operating contract
- [ ] Parent ADR - understand full context

**Context:**

- [ ] Parent ADR: `{parent_adr_path}`
- [ ] Related OBPIs in same ADR

**Prerequisites (check existence, STOP if missing):**

{prerequisites_md}

**Existing Code (understand current state):**

{existing_code_md}

## Quality Gates

<!-- Which gates apply and how to verify them. -->

### Gate 1: ADR

- [ ] Intent and scope recorded in this OBPI brief
- [ ] Parent ADR checklist item quoted

### Gate 2: TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] Tests derived from brief acceptance criteria, not from implementation
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed per behavior increment
- [ ] Tests pass: `uv run gz test`
- [ ] Validation commands recorded in evidence with real outputs

### Code Quality

- [ ] Lint clean: `uv run gz lint`
- [ ] Type check clean: `uv run gz typecheck`

<!-- Heavy lane only: -->
### Gate 3: Docs (Heavy only)

- [ ] Docs build: `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
- [ ] Relevant docs updated

### Gate 4: BDD (Heavy only)

- [ ] Acceptance scenarios pass: `uv run -m behave features/`

### Gate 5: Human (Heavy only)

- [ ] Human attestation recorded

## Verification

<!-- What commands verify this work? Use real repo commands, then paste the
     outputs into Evidence. -->

```bash
uv run gz validate --documents
uv run gz lint
uv run gz typecheck
uv run gz test

# Specific verification for this OBPI
{verification_specific_md}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Specific, testable criteria for completion.
Each checkbox MUST carry a deterministic REQ ID:
REQ-<semver>-<obpi_item>-<criterion_index>
-->

{acceptance_criteria_seed}

## Completion Checklist

<!-- Verify all gates before marking OBPI accepted. -->

- [ ] **Gate 1 (ADR):** Intent recorded in brief
- [ ] **Gate 2 (TDD):** RGR cycle followed, tests derived from brief, coverage maintained
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Lint, format, type checks clean
- [ ] **Value Narrative:** Problem-before vs capability-now is documented
- [ ] **Key Proof:** One concrete usage example is included
- [ ] **OBPI Acceptance:** Evidence recorded below

> For ceremony steps and lane-inheritance attestation rules, see `AGENTS.md` section `OBPI Acceptance Protocol`.

## Evidence

<!-- Record observations during/after implementation.
     Command outputs, file:line references, dates. -->

### Gate 1 (ADR)

- [ ] Intent and scope recorded

### Gate 2 (TDD)

```text
# Paste test output here
```

### Code Quality

```text
# Paste lint/format/type check output here
```

### Gate 3 (Docs)

## Tracked Defects

<!-- Record GitHub defect linkage when defects are discovered during this OBPI.
     Use one bullet per issue so status surfaces can preserve traceability. -->

_No defects tracked._

## Human Attestation

- Attestor: `<name>` when required, otherwise `n/a`
- Attestation: substantive attestation text or `n/a`
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD or `n/a`
