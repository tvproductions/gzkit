description: Answer "how do I …?" and "what can I …?" about gzkit by placing the question in one of its flows — which skill to run, which look-alike not to confuse it with, which steps only the operator may take, and what comes next. Use when the operator asks how to do something or what is possible, when unsure which gzkit skill or flow applies, or when choosing between two skills that look alike.

# gz-how

The map of how gzkit's skills fit together. Every skill belongs to a **flow**: a
path work travels, with an order, branches, and steps only the operator may take.
Find the flow, then say where the question sits in it.

This skill answers; it never acts and reads no project state. "What should I do
next *here*?" is `gz-status`'s question: it reads the ledger and the campaign.

## How to answer

1. **A question.** Match it in the question index, open the flow file it names
   under `references/`, and answer in this shape:
   - **Flow:** the flow, and where the question sits in it.
   - **Run:** the skill. Name a bare `uv run gz …` command only when no skill
     wraps the task.
   - **Not to be confused with:** the look-alike, when there is one.
   - **Only you can:** the steps reserved to the operator, if any.
   - **Then:** the next step in the flow.
2. **No question.** Answer "what can I do?": one line per flow, then the catalog.
3. **No match.** Say the question is not covered and show the flows. Never
   guess a skill. When an agent consulted this, it then runs the **Run** line
   itself.

### Not in the catalog

- `gz-how` — this guide.

## Look-alikes

| You want | Use | Not |
|---|---|---|
| where things stand and what to do next | `gz-status` | this guide (what is possible) or `gz-state` (the artifact graph) |
| relationships, what is unattested, what is ready | `gz-state` | `gz-status` (fronts and next actions) |
| whether one OBPI is complete | `uv run gz obpi status`, a command | `gz-state` (its completion is Layer 2; read the ledger) |
| one ADR's lifecycle | `gz-adr-status` | `gz-state` |
| the per-change gate | `gz-check` | `gz-implement` (Gate 2 for one ADR, writes the ledger) or `gz-validate` (one validator) |
| a brief checked against the code tree | `gz-obpi-brief-drift` | `gz-obpi-sync` (brief against ledger evidence) or `gz-adr-sync` (a whole ADR, every layer) |
| an issue filed from inside gzkit | `ghi-author` | `gz-issue-file` (from an adopter repository) |
| a correction, defect or discovery recorded | `gz-insights-remember` | `gz-content-remember` (changes canon) |
| an idea you can state, shaped | `gz-design` | `gz-rnd` (open problem, outcome unknown) or `gz-plan` (an ADR already decided) |
| one issue's work done | `ghi-close` | `ghi-triage` (ranks the whole queue) |
| code reviewed | `gz-obpi-simplify` | `gz-tech-debt-review` (a debt survey) |
| attestation evidence | `gz-arb` | `gz-check` (a bare run produces no receipt) |
| complexity help while writing | `gz-complexity-guide` | `gz-complexity-advisor` (a crossing at commit) or `gz-complexity-distill` (the doctrine) |
| to know whether it really works | `gz-intent-trace` | `gz-health-audit` (it feels wobbly), `gz-flighttest` (prove a flow), `gz-big-picture` (the wide view) |
| Gate 5 on an ADR | `gz-adr-closeout-ceremony` | `gz-adr-audit` (verification after attestation) |
| governance repaired | `gz-mx` | `gz-airlock` (reconnaissance with light repair at most) |
| session memory | `gz-session-handoff` | `gz-airlock` (transit) or `gz-obpi-lock` (occupancy) |
| a skill picked by intent | a namespace router | this guide (the flow around it) |

## Phase boundaries

Decide at a boundary between phases, never mid-phase; mid-phase, continue or
hand a bounded track to a subagent.

- **Continue** when the next phase needs this one verbatim: design into booking
  the ADR, plan into the pipeline.
- **Subagent** for a bounded, independent track, dispatched with its Why
  (`AGENTS.md` § Behavior Rules).
- **Compact** when the context still matters and the session continues;
  `CLAUDE.md` § Compact Instructions says what must survive.
- **Clear** when nothing here matters next; the ledger and the handoff chain
  carry the state.
- **Handoff** (`gz-session-handoff`) at the end of every session, and as a
  `CHECKPOINT` to bookmark mid-flight. In gzkit a handoff is session memory and
  carries the operator's rulings forward, not only a way to move work elsewhere.
- **Airlock** (`gz-airlock`) when entering or leaving a unit of work. Transit,
  exchange and handoff are three subjects; the ruling that separates them is
  carried verbatim in `gz-session-handoff` § Three subjects.
