## Current State Summary

Healed the four clipped settled rulings and landed a covering witness for the class (`8002cb96d`), synced clean, then authored three of ADR-0.36.0's nine OBPI briefs to passing authored-readiness. `origin/main` was level at `0 0` after the sync; the tree now carries the uncommitted brief work.

The clip repair was advised step 3 of the resumed anchor and the only step authorized when the session opened. Steps 1, 2 and 4 were booked set-aside — then step 2 was REVERSED in flight by a later operator ruling, which is what produced the brief authoring. Six briefs (04 through 09) remain untouched scaffolds; the session was stopped at three by the ruling to write this handoff rather than by reaching a natural boundary.

## Important Context

THE PREDECESSOR'S DAMAGE CENSUS WAS TRANSPOSED, and scoping the repair from its prose would have missed a clip. It recorded `3 clipped and 4 near-duplicate groups`; measured against the corpus the head carried `4 clipped and 3 abridged twins`. The two classes are genuinely different repairs and only one was authorized: a TRUE CLIP's fuller form is recoverable only UPSTREAM, so operator words were lost in transit; an ABRIDGED TWIN's fuller form is ALREADY carried in the same document, so nothing was lost and the repair would be a removal, not a lengthening. `_ruling_key` declines that collapse on purpose — a visible duplicate is harmless, folding two entries that merely look alike drops a booked ruling silently.

THE AUTHORED GATE FAILS ON THE SCAFFOLD'S OWN HTML COMMENT, which is a trap worth naming before the next six briefs. `STRICT_PLACEHOLDERS` in `src/gzkit/hooks/obpi.py` contains the literal string `one-sentence concrete outcome`, which is the text of the Objective section's scaffold comment. Deleting that one comment turns all nine briefs green without a word of authoring. That is the `Metagaming / gaming the gate` pattern in `.gzkit/rules/agent-failure-modes.md`; the gate is a floor, and `gz-obpi-specify` SKILL.md says plainly that the semantic authoring pass is mandatory.

TWO MECHANICAL AUTHORING TRAPS COST REAL TIME AND WILL COST IT AGAIN. First, a green-field allowed path is exempted from the existence check only by the LITERAL phrase `intentionally created in this OBPI` appearing on a Discovery Checklist line with the path; `brief_path_validity.py` mines that exact string, so rewording the scaffold's phrasing silently destroys the declaration channel and four legitimate net-new paths read as fabricated. Second, `.gzkit/skills/second-opinion/**` FAILS where `.gzkit/skills/second-opinion/` passes, because `_normalize_for_creates` strips `./` and a trailing slash but never `*`, so the glob and directory forms normalize to different keys. Both are the one-document-many-parsers class the module's own comments name.

THE NINE BRIEFS ARE ADR CONTENTS, NOT HANDOFF STEPS, and the provenance is layered. The anchor's advised step 2 only REPORTS state (`measured 0/9 this session with every brief draft (scaffold)`) and tells the reader to re-read it live. The instruction to author them is a SETTLED RULING in the same document. The campaign outranks both: operator canon makes the active campaign Magna Carta, and campaign line 129 reads `Promotion is done; the remaining work is the nine OBPIs`.

THE PARENT ADR HAD NO `## Boundary Invariants` SECTION, which meant `[STRUCTURAL-FENCE]` REQs had no proof channel at all — that section is the kind's only channel. Its Target Scope already declared two real cross-OBPI boundaries, so the section was warranted rather than invented; a third was added for the dark-door/pilot pair.

## Decisions Made

- [operator-ruled] Work advised step 3, the settled-rulings clip repair (verbatim: "Step 3 — settled-rulings clip repair"), selected from a four-option picker. Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 1, 2 and 4 recorded set-aside.
- [operator-ruled] Sync the clip repair (verbatim: "git sync it").
- [operator-ruled] REVERSED the step-2 set-aside in flight and authorized authoring the nine ADR-0.36.0 briefs (verbatim: "Step 2 — author the nine ADR-0.36.0 briefs"). Recorded as an `improvement` insight under scope `campaign-sequencing` so the booked `--set-aside` text cannot be misread as evidence the critic build stayed deferred.
- [operator-ruled] Stop the brief run and author this handoff (verbatim: "re-evaluate for a fresh handoff"). Six briefs remain scaffolds by ruling, not by oversight.
- [agent-chose] Healed only the four true clips and left the three abridged twins, because the twins lost nothing in transit and their repair is a dedup-policy change on `_dedup_rulings`, a path both composition steps share deliberately.
- [agent-chose] Discriminated clip from twin by WHERE the fuller form lives rather than by a bare prefix test, because a naive "no ruling is a prefix of another" predicate cannot tell them apart and fires on all seven.
- [agent-chose] Added `## Boundary Invariants` to the parent ADR rather than avoiding `[STRUCTURAL-FENCE]` REQs, since that section is the kind's only proof channel.
- [agent-chose] Did NOT delete the scaffold Objective comment to clear the authored gate, though it would have turned all nine green in one edit.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. AUTHOR OBPI-0.36.0-04 THROUGH -09 — six scaffolds remain. The pattern is proven by 01 through 03 and both traps are named in Important Context above: declare green-field paths with the literal phrase `intentionally created in this OBPI`, and use directory form rather than `**`. Read the ADR's § Target Scope and § Why nine for each unit's real boundary before writing.

2. REPAIR THE PARENT ADR'S `## Fidelity Assertions` TABLE. It still carries the scaffold's example row (`Replace with an assertion that exercises this ADR's thesis` against `uv run gz --version`). It parses, so `gz validate --fidelity-presence` passes while the ADR asserts nothing about its own thesis — a check whose subject is narrower than its name, the same family the campaign's doctrine-declared-without-mechanism box tracks.

3. RULE ON THE THREE ABRIDGED TWINS. They are inherited unrepaired and are NOT clip damage. Repair means changing `_ruling_key` or `_dedup_rulings` on a shared composition path, so it wants a covering test first and an explicit ruling on the collapse direction.

4. CONSIDER FILING THE MULTI-PARENT LINEAGE GAP — `continues_from` is single-valued, so a genuine merge cannot be expressed and the 2026-08-11 collapse had to carry one parent by value. Confirmed unfiled against the six open GHIs.

5. THEN THE BUILD ITSELF. Nothing of ADR-0.36.0 is implemented — `gz adr status` reports 0/9 with every brief pending. Authoring the briefs is not the campaign item; the campaign item is the build.

## Pending Work / Open Loops

THE THREE ABRIDGED TWINS ARE UNREPAIRED, carried forward from the collapse unchanged. The clip arm now has a mechanical census that enumerates it on every run; the twin arm has none and is counted only in transcribed prose.

SIX OF NINE ADR-0.36.0 BRIEFS ARE UNAUTHORED SCAFFOLDS — 04 agent-door, 05 decision-envelope, 06 risk-tiering, 07 verdict-resolution-transition, 08 pilot-instrumentation, 09 asked-question-gate-dark.

THE OPEN-COUNT INSTRUMENT IS STILL THE WRONG ONE and remains unbuilt, carried unfiled across several predecessors. Nothing tracks defect rate, found-versus-introduced, or time-to-detection.

THREE DEFECTS TRACKED AND NOT FIXED, all via `gz insights remember`: no `*.jsonl merge=union` strategy in `.gitattributes`; the unresolved `Path.cwd()` fallback in the control-surface-sync hook; and `gz typecheck` corrupting diagnostic coordinates by expanding emoji shortcodes.

THE 40 ACCEPTED UNCALLED GATES remain disclosed rather than adjudicated.

29 OF 39 CHORES still run the full unit suite as a criterion, roughly 43 minutes of duplicated work in a full sweep. Unfiled.

THE INSTRUCTIONS-FILE BUDGET WORK STAYS PARKED by standing ruling until the product stabilizes; the two `surface-delivery-witness` warnings on `gz check` are that parked condition, not new drift.

## Verification Checklist

The brief work is unverified beyond authored-readiness — no test was written and no code was implemented for ADR-0.36.0. Confirm the split before trusting anything above:

```
uv run gz obpi validate --adr ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic --authored
uv run gz adr status ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic
uv run gz validate --req-kind-discipline
uv run gz check
```

Expect 3 PASS and 6 FAIL on the first, and 0/9 on the second — authoring a brief lands no OBPI. The clip repair is verified independently and is mechanical rather than narrated:

```
uv run -m unittest tests.governance.test_settled_ruling_integrity -v
uv run gz validate --lock-exchange-coupling
```

Session state confirmed before authoring: `gz check` exited 0 after the clip repair; `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` returned `0 0` at `6870380cc`; 241 handoff governance tests passed. The tree is dirty with the ADR amendment and briefs 01-03.

## Evidence / Artifacts

Landed this session:

- `tests/governance/test_settled_ruling_integrity.py` — the clip witness; RED at exit 1 enumerating all four, GREEN after the heal
- `.gzkit/handoffs/20260811T013359Z-forked-chain-collapsed-ruling-corpora-unioned.md` — the healed anchor, four rulings restored in place

Authored but uncommitted:

- `docs/design/adr/pre-release/ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic/ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic.md` — gained `## Boundary Invariants`
- `docs/design/adr/pre-release/ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic/obpis/OBPI-0.36.0-01-critic-skill-contract.md`
- `docs/design/adr/pre-release/ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic/obpis/OBPI-0.36.0-02-cross-family-transport.md`
- `docs/design/adr/pre-release/ADR-0.36.0-convergence-moment-cross-family-critic/obpis/OBPI-0.36.0-03-operator-door.md`

Surfaces read to ground the authoring:

- `src/gzkit/hooks/obpi.py` — `_validate_authored_readiness` and `STRICT_PLACEHOLDERS`
- `src/gzkit/governance/brief_path_validity.py` — `_normalize_for_creates`, `_SCAFFOLDED_CREATES_HINT`
- `src/gzkit/arb/step_reporter.py` — the receipt's `command` argv field
- `src/gzkit/commands/obpi_complete_adversarial.py` — Step 4b's resolution shape and cross-vendor predicates
- `docs/governance/build-to-1.0-campaign-2026-07-18.md` — campaign line 129

## Settled Rulings

- Work the degrading tier starting with #696 (verbatim authorization booked via gz handoff authorize, session 81765765).
- Finish what is on the plate rather than deferring items for later sequencing rulings.
- Do not assert campaign-movement intent without reading it; the claim that Movement C is shrinking the pre-1.0 board was fabricated and is withdrawn. Movement C is Reduce the accretion.
- #696 defect 2 was the buildable cut; defects 3/4 were NOT to be left to an unbuilt ADR.
- Reframe #580 from periphery criticality to truncation survival (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: 'reframe #580 to truncation survival'). The mechanism is unchanged; the warrant and ranking source are replaced. Arrived AFTER the prior handoff was written and was carried by neither its Decisions nor its Settled section.
- #580's survival declaration is ratified with must-survive = ranks 1-11 (operator-doctrine-verbatim-canon first, architectural-boundaries last), cumulative 21582 B, leaving 11186 B of growth headroom. Ranks 12-20 are declared expendable-under-pressure because they are recoverable, not because they are unimportant. Ratified as data only: applying the order to committed AGENTS.md remains a Layer-1 canon change requiring Gate-5 attestation.
- #580's destination is SPLIT, not a single home. The witness half (declaration plus the assertion that every must-survive section begins before the vendor cap, plus fail-closed declaration completeness) lands with GHI #712. The reorder half (permuting the surface) parks to pool post-1.0, because only it is expensive and it pays off only once the cap binds. This supersedes the withdrawn whole-issue pool recommendation, which rested on a false claim about Movement C.
- GHI #607 is UNPARKED. Attested REQ-0.14.0-04-04 asserts a detection capability and is silent on scope, so an adopter-scope predicate that preserves gzkit's own self-enforcement does not falsify it. No repudiation and no amendment are required to work the issue.
- Work advised steps 1 through 4 (verbatim authorization "do 1 to 4", booked via gz handoff authorize, session 8b138d99).
- Mechanize GHI-blocker freshness by extending the bundled triage script rather than adding a gz verb, so the signal lands in the report the operator already reads before pulling work.
- Work GHI #712 (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: 'authorized, proceed with GHI #712'; booked via gz handoff authorize, session bb837938). This authorized the resumed handoff's advised step 1 only; steps 2 through 5 were not authorized and were not worked.
- Fix the gz check advisory-visibility defect, and file it as a GHI first (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: 'yes, fix this defect'). The defect was surfaced for routing rather than fixed unilaterally because it changes a shared renderer's output contract for every step; the operator's ruling converted it into authorized work.
- Fix the gz check advisory-visibility defect, and file it as a GHI first (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: 'yes, fix this defect'). It had been surfaced for routing rather than fixed unilaterally because it changes a shared renderer's output contract for every step.
- Fix the settled-ruling dedup defect, then author a fresh handoff (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: 'fix, then write me a fresh handoff'). It had been surfaced with routing facts rather than fixed, because 'write handoff' is a narrow skill scope and Always #17 forbids launching unrequested implementation work off the back of one.
- Fix the CI failure (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "fix this:"; booked via gz handoff authorize, session bd43ecd7). This authorized the CI repair only; the resumed handoff's five advised steps were not authorized and were not worked.
- Write the entire triage into a new handoff for context cleanup (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "write entire triage to new handoff, i want to clean up").
- Work the triage list in its ranked order (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "continue on the triage list"; booked via `gz handoff authorize`, session 6aa88bcf). This resolved the predecessor handoff's advised step 1 by ruling the pull order to be the ranking already recorded in `.gzkit/cache/triage/rank.json`, which puts GHI #615 first.
- Proceed with GHI #615 cuts 2 and 3 (migration plus strict enforcement) rather than sampling first or switching to GHI #607.
- Escalation should key on lifecycle rather than on frontmatter shape (operator selected the recommended option after the three dispositions were presented). Implementation is preserved but not landed, because measurement afterwards showed it does not by itself reach a green gate.
- Dimension-aware Draft scoping: a Draft brief does NOT gate on its own deliverables (allowlist existence, `gz` verb resolution) but DOES still gate on prerequisites (Discovery Checklist, citations). Landed as 5111b7dd.
- Book the patch release as the session's work and leave the resumed handoff's five advised steps unauthorized (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "/gz-patch-release"; booked via gz handoff authorize, session e6b3da00). GHI #615's held migration was NOT authorized and was not worked.
- Backfill the runtime label on #532 and #682 only, not on #533 or #710 (Step 1a labeling-recovery). Both landed genuine validator changes under gz validate; #533 is an open tracker with markdown-only commits and #710 was a skill-doc change, so the excluded bucket is correct for them per Step 1a's own guidance.
- Describe only what actually landed for the open GHIs in the narrative, omit #533 entirely, and file a GHI against the closure-marker heuristic after the release completed rather than pausing the ceremony.
- Approve the drafted release notes as written (operator verbatim: "yes"), triggering the Iron Law run of Steps 4a-4e without pauses.
- Fix GHI #714 via Direction 2 -- keep the commit marker authoritative for discovery, consult upstream state one layer down, and downgrade a still-OPEN GHI to a warned bucket the operator adjudicates (operator verbatim: "direction 2"). Directions 1 and 3 were declined.
- Deferring a proven defect with a governance-flavored rationale is not acceptable (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "slop, bullshit, facade, and wank"). The turn-closing "one thing worth your judgment" note on the git-sync gate gap was rejected as rationalized incompleteness; the correction produced the hook-enforcement investigation, its two commits, and GHI #715. Recorded as an improvement insight per Behavior Rule 11.
- Work GHI #715 and correct campaign line 131 (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "#715 + campaign line 131"; booked via `gz handoff authorize`, session e4c56baa). This authorized the resumed handoff's advised steps 1 and 2 only; steps 3, 4, and 5 were not authorized at that point.
- Route GHI #615's residual findings by mechanical re-triage into three classes, file a GHI for the scenario-reachability advisory, and confirm the brief_reconcile landing order (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "Mechanical re-triage into 3 classes; File a GHI; #615 -> #581 -> #641"; booked via `gz handoff authorize`). Routes (i), (ii), and (iii) were declined; building the scenario registry now and accepting Era-1 as permanent were declined; landing #641 first was declined.
- Book the patch release as this session's work and leave the resumed handoff's five advised steps unauthorized (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "/gz-patch-release"; booked via `gz handoff authorize`, session bfc3ccad). GHI #716, #615 cuts 2 and 3, #581, and #641 were NOT authorized and were not worked.
- Fix the CI failure, diagnosed by the operator from the job log as blocking skill-audit staleness rather than a code runtime defect (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "fix:"). This authorized the skill-audit repair only.
- Approve the v0.33.3 release narrative as drafted and execute it (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "yes, appprove the patch release narrative - do the work"), triggering the Iron Law run of Steps 4a through 4e without pauses.
- Decline the near-edge staleness sweep and record it in a handoff instead (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "no, but place it into a handoff and then git-sync the handoff").
- Authorize the git-sync only, before any handoff steps were worked (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "authorized, git-sync only"; booked via `gz handoff authorize`, session a76662eb). The stale-pinned handoff's five advised steps were NOT authorized at that point and were not worked.
- Work advised steps 1 through 5 of the current handoff (operator verbatim 2026-07-25: "do these:" followed by the five steps; booked via `gz handoff authorize`). Steps 1 through 3 were completed; 4 and 5 were not started.
- Resolve the skill-version pin collision by asserting the increment rather than the literal, chosen over updating the four frozen constants and over reverting the stamps. The equality pins contradicted REQ-0.0.35-02-04's own wording.
- Add a fixed 75-day non-blocking warn band, chosen over deriving the band from the ceiling and over leaving the gate binary.
- Retire ADR-0.0.33 Invariant 4 rather than build the scenario registry; GHI #716 closed withdrawn against the retirement commit.
- Fix the handoff evidence check's category error when the pre-push gate blocked the retirement, chosen over annotating the two sealed handoffs and over reverting the retirement.
- Work all four authorized buckets (operator verbatim 2026-07-26, booked via `gz handoff authorize`, session 7dd80db9): "GHI #615 cuts 2 and 3, Then #581, then #641, Steps 3 and 4 (the two cheap judgments), Fix the two handoff-surface defects".
- Fix the engine first, then repair genuine drift — chosen over rewriting 22 briefs to satisfy the scrapers as written, and over landing the extractor fixes as a separate prior commit.
- Seal the 8 pre-frontmatter ADR-0.0.1 briefs as `archived` rather than `Completed` — an honest claim that they are no longer a live authoring surface, without asserting a ledger completion they do not carry.
- Scope GHI #581 first and do NOT build — chosen over executing the 6-registry collapse, over building the 6th validator dimension, and over closing the issue unexamined.
- Take GHI #641's own strawman naming: `gz brief reconcile` becomes `gz obpi brief-drift`, `gz obpi reconcile` becomes `gz obpi sync`, and the single-verb `brief` namespace goes away.
- Fix the engine first, then repair genuine drift — chosen over rewriting 22 briefs to satisfy the scrapers as written.
- Seal the 8 pre-frontmatter ADR-0.0.1 briefs as `archived` rather than `Completed` — no ledger completion is asserted.
- Scope GHI #581 first and do NOT build — chosen over executing the collapse, over building the 6th validator dimension, and over closing it unexamined.
- Take GHI #641's own strawman naming, then execute it (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "refresh it" followed the landing; the rename itself was authorized by the strawman ruling and the follow-up "okay, so what about 641?").
- Work GHI buckets 1, 3, 4, and 5; decline bucket 2 (the Movement A campaign work).
- Retire .gzkit/schemas/ledger_events.json by forward supersession and keep the file.
- Write two pool ADRs (substrate + capability) crediting swarm-forge + superpowers (verbatim: "authorized -- write the two pool ADRs"; booked via gz handoff authorize, session 786a9e8f).
- Primary use case = parallel read-only review personas; parallelism itself "isn't too important"; record the alternatives (parallel OBPI impl / GHI fixes / ADR pipelines) as future scope.
- Allow ephemeral worktrees (scratch checkouts, land on main, no branch dance) -- a carve-out from "never create feature branches"; ratifying it is a hard promotion gate for ADR-pool.worktree-parallel-agents.
- Ledger concurrency = single-writer-by-construction (only merge-to-main writes Layer-2), NOT a daemon.
- Two pool ADRs (substrate + capability), not one combined nor three.
- Use the governed skill, not hand-scaffolding ("there is an adr authoring skill don't vibe"; "use skills - skills have rules + tools"). Recorded as an improvement insight.
- Fix GHI #718 via direction (a), the skill-doc fix (chosen via AskUserQuestion).
- File the #718 follow-on via /ghi-author (became GHI #719).
- A git-sync is ALWAYS authorized and never gated on a handoff (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "yes, just do my git-sync - a git-sync will ALWAYS be authorized - think about it, if we need to sync with remote, your local handoff is almost always likely to have been superseded by something on remote. Challenging me on a handoff for a git-sync is silly."). Booked via `gz handoff authorize` against both the gating handoff and, after the pull replaced it, its successor. Borne out mechanically in-session: the 24 pulled commits had already landed all five advised steps of the handoff being gated on.
- Add the local `user.name = g0` guard (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "yes, do the user.name = g0 guard.").
- Fix GHI #720 with the recompute approach rather than reordering the ceremony to pull before committing (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "fix #720 with the recompute").
- Fix GHI #722 by failing closed at authoring rather than widening the parser (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "fix #722 by failing closed at authoring"). Direction (a), widening `_section_items`, was declined.
- Write this successor handoff rather than leave the stale claim standing (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "yes, write the successor handoff").
- Fix GHI #723 with the buffer flag (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "fix #723 with the buffer flag").
- File the smoke-budget breach as a GHI (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "file the smoke budget GHI"), which became #724.
- Write this successor handoff (operator verbatim 2026-07-26: "write the successor handoff").
- Fix the Windows defects in this clone rather than pushing from WSL (chosen over the recommended push-from-WSL route).
- Track the cross-platform findings as one GHI covering the class, not three sibling issues.
- Handoffs must never block a git-sync (operator verbatim 2026-08-09: "handoffs should never, never, never, ever, block git-sync. NEVER."), reaffirming the 2026-07-26 standing ruling and converting it into a mechanical exemption plus a covering test.
- Add `windows-latest` to `ci.yml`; macOS excluded on cost-versus-distinct-failure-class grounds.
- Do not blame a cross-platform defect on the tool's implementation language (operator verbatim: "Don't blame things on ty, it was designed to work with Python"). Configuring ty portably is gzkit's job.
- Track ty FORWARD, never pinned backward (operator verbatim: "we progress as Ty progresses, if it has become more strict, then we tighten up, do not avoid hard work by clinging to older version of Ty"). This overruled the `gz-deps-upgrade` Risk-notes recovery posture and the agent's `ty==0.0.55` pin.
- Fix the audit predicate and the rule table immediately rather than filing a GHI, and keep the 324 `features/` removals.
- Book the resumed anchor as proceed with every advised step set aside, sync only (verbatim: "sync only, handoff steps deferred").
- Proceed on the newest handoff with no step set aside (verbatim: "proceed wth newest"; spelling preserved).
- Fix the Windows hook defect at both arms, resolve symmetry AND fail closed, rather than the resolve fix alone or filing it (selected from a three-option picker).
- Enable `unused-type-ignore-comment`, clear all 36 dead suppressions, and record the measurement in the config (selected from a three-option picker, after the measured cost came in at five times the figure the predecessor recorded).
- Ratchet forward on Mechanical-row witnessing and work the multi-property tranche first, rather than a full 64-row sweep or re-scoring the column (selected from a three-option picker).
- Take the three structural repairs cheapest-first, ordered transcribed views, then growth brake, then witness density (selected from a four-option picker whose alternatives were highest-leverage-first, build the measurement instrument first, and set them aside for campaign time).
- Remedial action against a closed feature routes as a GHI direct fix referencing the original ADR (operator verbatim 2026-08-06: 'GHIs that direct fix and reference the original adr seems prudent to me. this is a grey area, but the best I have at the moment'). The residual the canon does not cover: a correction never traces back to the ADR it repaired.
- Work the session as 'commit, then traige' (verbatim), booked via gz handoff decide; advised steps 1, 3 and 4 were recorded set-aside, step 1 because origin/main was already 0/0 and the sync it advised had run before the predecessor handoff's ink dried.
- Do the top 5 of the triage list (verbatim: 'let's do the top 5 on the triage list').
- Direct fix beats riding the pool ADR where the fix removes or reuses rather than adding a parallel reader (operator: 'pool won't be promoted soon, is direct fix better?'). Applied per-item, which is what caught #581.
- Park all instructions-file budget work until the product stabilizes (verbatim: 'don't worry about any instructions file budgets right now, we want the product to stabilize').
- No ARB purge until insight retention is solid (verbatim: 'i don't want purges until guaranteed summaries for action-taking remedies are in place'), on the stated ground that 'there is no point in 1/2 measures now unless we are going to solve now'.
- Align the forcing-function surfaces as a direct fix (verbatim: 'ALIGN THESE!!!'), characterized by the operator as 'a direct fix for what is a clear defect of misalignment/incomplete implementation'.
- Build the efficacy channel (verbatim: 'efficacy channel is right — build it - these are all defects of design').
- Remedial action against a closed feature routes as a GHI direct fix referencing the original ADR (verbatim: 'GHIs that direct fix and reference the original adr seems prudent to me. this is a grey area, but the best I have at the moment'). This restates canon the operator had already booked; the genuine residual is that a correction never traces BACK to its ADR.
- The OBPI process must NOT be altered at all (verbatim: 'we will NOT alter the OBPI process, at all! This is a broader and per-session tool need'). This forecloses the critic alternative of extending adversarial_validation with a phase discriminator. Booked to insights 2026-08-07.
- Generalizing FROM the existing 4b skills and tooling is acceptable, but the OBPI pipeline itself stays untouched (verbatim: 'it is possible we generalize from the existing skills/tooling for obpi 4b, but I am hesitant to alter anything about the obpi pipeline as it is the most enduringly stable part of gzkit').
- The trigger is the convergence moment (verbatim: 'we are trying to jump in when you offer analyzed and considered design options in the same structed way - you've achieved convergence, within that session, when you do so, I need a 2nd opinion in that exact moment'). Explicitly not an Airlock Jr.
- Stated goal for the whole session, verbatim: 'retain cross-family review for consequential decisions'.
- Vendor posture is deliberately concrete, not generic (verbatim: 'I am trying to be specific: The US Air Force, the Chinese Air Force, etc. we can refactor to generics once we have platform stability'). Claude is the daily driver; Codex is the named adversary; the lock-in risk is accepted knowingly (verbatim: 'I need forward momentum, not design niceties - they can come with the refactor').
- Experimental refinement is expected (verbatim: 'we can experimentally refine this moving forward'), so a calibrated pilot is compatible with the ruling; a universal fail-closed gate on day one is not required.
- Park all instructions-file budget work until the product stabilizes (carried from the predecessor session).
- The critic accompanies the question rather than being absorbed by the agent (verbatim: "yes, it is a 2nd opinion, not a usurped opinion. this seems fitting: 'I re-pose the question carrying the critic's verdict unedited, the same way § Attestation makes me pass your words through unchanged.'"). `updatedInput` proved stronger than the ruling required: the harness enforces the passthrough, so the critique never enters the agent's context before the operator sees it.
- Maximum information flows to the hook (verbatim: "we should pass max information to the hook"). Already satisfied by the harness -- `transcript_path` gives the critic the entire session.
- The option cap and similar limits are accepted as design inputs (verbatim: "we can work with 4 options, and other limitations - contraints usually strengthen designs"; spelling preserved).
- Allowing the critic to actually run is the named next blocker (verbatim: "we need to allow the critic to operate, so that needs resolution").
- No OBPI-pipeline mechanism may be imported into this design yet (verbatim: "do not conflate any mechanism for the obpi pipeline with this work just yet"). The withdrawn latency figure is the concrete casualty.
- The agent equivocates after presenting converged options (verbatim: "the option you always provide is 'discuss this' (approximating): the critic needs to engage your premise. You almost always equivocate and hedge in the narrative that follows. easly a discernible majority of the time."; spelling preserved). Booked to insights as an `improvement` under scope `agent-narrative-discipline`.
- Authorized the probe and required the agent to clear its own gate (verbatim: "On probe, we can't proceed unless you do so"). Booked via `gz handoff decide` against the predecessor.
- Work all five advised steps (verbatim: "do the advised steps"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; no step set aside.
- Injection shape is preamble-always plus an appended option when the base question carries 3 or fewer (selected from a 3-option picker with rendered previews). The critic's PREMISE-ATTACK/VERDICT map to the preamble, its UNASKED line to the option label.
- memory-hygiene is restructured, not retired: replace the witness and fix the wheel-shipped path defect, deferring the 41-file migration that would grow the parked instruction surface.
- Fix defects when found rather than parking them behind a fence ruling (verbatim: "do it right - fix defects when found"). This authorized the GHI #678 repair after the agent had parked it; standing canon already grants direct-repair authority to GHI-tracked defects, so the park was the error.
- Scope challenge on Step 4b (verbatim: "4b is opbi stuff, why surface it here? is it one of the 5 items?"). It IS advised step 3; it entered the design session because Step 4b is the existing precedent for cross-family adversarial review. The agent had flagged the campaign-sequencing tension but missed the OBPI-fence tension, which was the sharper of the two.
- Do advised steps 1 and 2 from the resumed handoff (verbatim: "do 1 and 2"); steps 3, 4 and 5 recorded set-aside via gz handoff decide.
- Rule and build, not merely rule (verbatim: "explain further, also, rule and build").
- The AskUserQuestion critic design belongs in a pool ADR, not a GHI comment (verbatim: "maybe the askuserquestion work should have been made into a pool adr - the handoff to handoff method seems to be diluting its design").
- Recover the design at full fidelity immediately (verbatim: "get it into a pool adr now, while the iron is hot" and "yes, do full capture, full recall, max context for highest quality adr authoring").
- Transcripts may be copied into an ADR package as appendices, trimmed to relevant passages but never condensed (verbatim: "allow transcripts to be copied as appenditures to an adr within its folder - these are vital original sources. so, this: "into the repo as ADR evidence" - they could be cleaned up to include only relevant passages - not condensed summaries, just trimmed").
- R1 -- the critic performs BOTH scope and conclusion challenge with full context; the either/or framing is rejected (verbatim: "why is this a choice? we want the adversary to get full context. measure twice, cut once").
- R2 -- the critic is a SKILL with three invocation doors: operator, agent, or gate (verbatim: "this is a skill but can be invoked by me, by agent, or at gate").
- R3 -- post-verdict resolution is operator plus main agent, modeled on Step 4b (verbatim: "operator and main agent work for resolution. obpi pipeline 4b already handles this well - observe it").
- R4 -- use the built-in Codex integration rather than a hand-rolled port (verbatim: "we just want to run the most up-to-date codex. Anthropic offers a built-in feature to call a codex adversary, why not use that and keep it simple?").
- GHI #766 takes option B -- retire the bookmark document, keep the signal as a ledger event -- with SessionStart as the forcing function (verbatim: "I liked your ledger suggestion, I just want sessionstart to see that legder entry and consult the transcripts").
- A handoff must carry its transcript so sensemaking is corroborated by the primary source; the ledger path is the floor, not the goal (verbatim: "I should get HIGHER QUALITY results when I call for a handoff that the ounter-checks the transcript, but I'll get some quality if I see that ledger entry and force the just-initiated agent to review prior transcript").
- The corroboration doctrine is ADR-shaped, not rule-shaped (verbatim challenge: "ok, but why not an adr?"). The agent's rule-file recommendation was withdrawn as a second instance of under-routing.
- Campaign placement for ADR-pool.convergence-moment-cross-family-critic is provisionally after ADR-0.35.0, explicitly not yet decided (verbatim: "after 0.35.0 I guess, not ready to decide").
- Proceed with sync first and the ADR second (verbatim: "Proceed — sync, then ADR"), booked via gz handoff decide against the predecessor handoff with no step set aside.
- The corroboration doctrine takes kind pool, not feature, after the agent offered a closed foundation kind and was challenged (verbatim: "why are you offering foundation ADRs?").
- Only one feature at a time (verbatim: "only one feature at a time, feature, finish, draw from pool"). Pool is the staging queue, not post-1.0 deferral; ADR-0.35.0 is the in-flight feature so a second feature ADR was never available.
- The archive half of the corroboration doctrine carries a redaction obligation stated at doctrine level, with the standing operator-PII prohibition binding on appendices. A mechanical pre-commit scrub gate was offered and declined.
- Fold three forcing-function findings into ADR scope: portable transcript references, a pointer liveness signal, and producer-stamped rather than authored.
- Fix both flagged items (verbatim: "fix both items") - the GHI #766 cross-reference and the orphan warnings.
- Work advised step 1 first (verbatim: "Step 1 first — rule on splitting GHI #766"), then return to the campaign; advised steps 3 and 4 recorded set-aside via `gz handoff decide`.
- Split GHI #766 and park both halves behind the doctrine ADR (verbatim: "Split; park both behind the doctrine ADR"). #767 filed for the transcript channel; #766 keeps bookmark retirement and is blocked by it.
- Correct the stale campaign counts and file the class-level defect (verbatim: "Fix it and file the class-level defect") — produced GHI #768.
- Sync, then survey ADR-0.35.0 before touching code (verbatim: "Sync, then survey ADR-0.35.0 first").
- Extend `gz content retire` in place rather than rename it to `withdraw` (verbatim: "Extend `retire` in place"); ADR-0.35.0 amended at five sites to match.
- Verify the family clustering before amending Magna Carta (verbatim: "Verify first, then ratify").
- Build the class-of-failure index as a real surface before writing campaign boxes against it (verbatim: "Build the class-of-failure index first").
- Ratify both Movement C amendments (verbatim: "ratify both, write handoff, git-sync").
- Determine C2's status before pulling the next work item (verbatim: "Determine C2 status first"). This overrode the agent's recommendation to set advised step 2 aside and go straight to GHI #770; the determination is what found the second-dispatch-path residual. Booked via `gz handoff decide`, with advised steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 recorded set-aside.
- Close the C2 residual immediately rather than filing it or amending around it (verbatim: "Close the residual now (Recommended)").
- Check C2 off, amend the campaign with the determination, and sync (verbatim: "Check C2 + sync").
- Work GHI #770 (verbatim: "do 770").
- Work advised step 4, the `gz git-sync` commit-shape question (verbatim: "Rule on the git-sync commit shape (step 4)"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 1, 2, 3 and 5 recorded set-aside, step 1 with the note that it is unexecutable as written because all five of its named members are closed.
- Refuse the bundle — `gz git-sync` fails closed when staged files carry source scope (verbatim: "Refuse the bundle (fence at sync)"). Selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews; the alternatives were split-the-commit, fix-the-query-not-the-commit, and warn-do-not-refuse.
- Write the recommendations into a handoff rather than executing them (verbatim: "write recommendations to handoff. git-sync"). D1 through D5 are carried as advised steps below, none of them started.
- Work D2 first, then D1 (verbatim: "D2 first, then D1"). Booked via `gz handoff decide` against the anchor; D3, D4 and D5 recorded set-aside.
- Take the converged `ghi-close` reading of D2 rather than the campaign-box or GHI #768 readings (selected from a four-option picker after the agent reported that D2's handoff arm had already landed in `ef3f9e0a2`). Both remaining arms land on one file, so "D2 first, then D1" was executed as a single pass.
- Author this handoff (verbatim: "write the handoff").
- Continue defect repair rather than pulling the campaign's Movement A sequence position (verbatim: "continue defect repair", given twice). This answered the predecessor handoff's advised step 1, which had put the sequencing question first precisely because it governs the other four.
- Author this handoff and sync (verbatim: "create new handoff - git sync").
- Pull the `#669` chain from the resumed handoff advised steps (verbatim: "Pull the #669 chain"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 recorded set-aside.
- Collapse the three guard mechanisms to one monitor rather than mechanizing the current shape (selected from a four-option picker: collapse / validator-over-current-shape / route-to-pool / record-and-move-on). This ruling also selected the ROUTE: collapse frames the work as a correction against ADR-0.31.0 and routes to direct fix, where the validator-over-current-shape arm would have been an enhancement adding a CLI flag and routed to OBPI ceremony.
- Work advised steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the resumed handoff; step 5 (scan for fail-closed refusals with no manpage coverage) recorded set-aside for the fourth time. Booked via `gz handoff decide`.
- GHI #768 takes accept-and-disclaim plus a fence, selected from a four-option picker over the four remedies filed in the issue body. The alternatives declined were marked-syntax validator, generated block, and commit-time coupling. Stop writing the number down; add a narrow check so the subtraction cannot decay back into a convention.
- GHI #581 closes `superseded` citing `ADR-pool.governance-document-structural-validation`, selected from a three-option picker. The alternatives declined were re-affirm TRACK-ONLY in the body, and direct-fix the third failure class only.
- The canonical typecheck scope widens to tree-minus-features, selected from a four-option picker. The alternatives declined were add-scripts-only, fix-the-diagnostics-without-a-scope-change, and leave-both-and-record-as-accepted.
- The Movement C doctrine-declared-without-mechanism box is kept open and re-scoped to its criterion, selected from a three-option picker. The alternatives declined were check-it-off and split-the-box.
- Correct the count, then work the arm (verbatim: "Correct the count, then work the arm"). Selected from a four-option picker after the agent reported that the campaign criterion figure did not reproduce. Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 recorded set-aside.
- Work all 9 rows as drafted (verbatim: "Work all 9 as drafted"), from a four-option picker over the agent-drafted per-row disposition table.
- Rows 49 and 62 re-score to Judgment rather than being mechanized (verbatim: "Re-score both to Judgment (Recommended)"). This ratified the agent withdrawing its own mechanize recommendation after probes disproved the premise.
- Work the grandfathered rules one per commit, through all four (verbatim: "One rule per commit, work through all four"), accepting the full clause-scoring cost the Coverage Ledger forces.
- Enable BLE001 and defer PLC0415 (verbatim: "Enable BLE001, defer PLC0415 (Recommended)"). Six live bare-except violations are the observed drift the promotion freeze requires; the 138 lazy imports need per-site readings against the rule own carve-outs.
- Author this handoff (verbatim: "yes, author the handoff").
- Work all five advised steps (verbatim: "Step 1 — skill arm, Step 2 — ruff-code reachability check, Steps 3+4 — record deferred postures as accepted, Step 5 — rule on ADR-0.44.0,  we DO NOT go out of sequence (0.44.0)"). Selected as a multi-select over the agent-drafted step table; no step set aside.
- ADR-0.44.0 is PARKED, not finished (verbatim: "we DO NOT go out of sequence (0.44.0)"). This forecloses the checkbox's first arm; the agent had wrongly offered pull-it as live when campaign sequencing already ruled it out, and logged that as an improvement insight under scope handoff-resume-presentation.
- ADR-0.44.0 is an agent overreach with three acceptable dispositions (verbatim: "this was originally an agent overeach. this either becomes 0.36.0, revert to pool, or we just ignore/deleted the implemented code - I won't be paralyzed in purgatory."; spelling preserved). The closing clause is a standing instruction against stalling on this class of decision.
- File GHIs and fix them (verbatim: "ghis and fix - we are plagued by misalignments like this."). The second clause set the bar at class-level couplings rather than instance patches.
- Do not resequence out of order (verbatim: "we DO NOT go out of sequence (0.44.0)"), which foreclosed finishing the ADR in place.
- Review the handoff, then work advised step 1 (verbatim: "review the handoff", then "do step 1"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 were recorded set-aside at that point.
- Fix the H1/id mismatch as a class: rewrite all 38 pool files, fix `gz adr demote`, and narrow the byte-for-byte preservation test (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews). This overrode the agent's recommendation to leave the mismatch alone, and the operator was right: the agent had verified there was no code consumer but had not checked whether the stale ids collide with live ones. Eight do.
- Sync the work (verbatim: "Sync now"), selected from a two-option picker.
- Scope GHI #777 as a class fix — teach `gz adr demote` to strip the kind-invalid ceremony section and backfill, rather than editing the id per line or fixing only the 8 observable collisions (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews).
- Work advised step 2 (verbatim: "do step 2"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`, reversing its earlier set-aside.
- Repair `rename_chain_target` by subsumption — one shared fold with both readers delegating — rather than repairing it in place, deleting it, or recording the finding without a fix (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews).
- Author this handoff carrying advised steps 3, 4 and 5 forward (verbatim: "write steps 3-5 to a fresh handoff").
- Review the handoff, then work advised step 1 (verbatim: "review handoff", then "Step 1 — widen the check"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2, 3 and 4 were recorded set-aside at that point.
- Scope the widened check to executable witness paths plus ruff family citations, and NOT to `gz validate` scope flags (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews). The flag arm was declined on the agent's own evidence that it finds nothing today — 36 cited flags, 36 resolve — and that the promotion-order freeze admits a check only on observed drift.
- Enable PTH package-scoped rather than re-scoring row 41 to Judgment (verbatim: "Enable PTH, package-scoped"), selected from a four-option picker after the agent surfaced that the grandfather pin on `cross-platform.md` makes the re-score path cost a full clause re-score while the enable path costs no rule edit.
- File a GHI through `/ghi-author` for the missing ARB rule-file citation rather than investigating it in-session or logging an insight (verbatim: "File a GHI via /ghi-author"), selected from a three-option picker. Produced GHI #778.
- Author this handoff and sync (verbatim: "write fresh handoff and git sync").
- Work advised steps 1 and 3 of the resumed handoff, instance-scope only on GHI #778 (verbatim: "Step 1 — fix GHI #778, Steps 1 + 3 — fix, then triage" and "Instance only (Recommended)"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2 and 4 recorded set-aside.
- Rule the sequencing question after #778 and the triage (verbatim: "Fix #769, then pull ADR-0.35.0 (Recommended)"), selected from a four-option picker. This reversed the earlier set-aside of advised step 4.
- REVERSED that sequencing ruling in flight once #769 landed (verbatim selection: "Work more defect repair instead"). ADR-0.35.0 was NOT pulled. Recorded as an `improvement` insight under scope `campaign-sequencing` so the booked `gz handoff decide` text cannot be misread as evidence the feature was started.
- The "we will NOT alter the OBPI process, at all" freeze is NARROW (verbatim selection: "Freeze is narrow — work #765 in full"). It bars importing the cross-family critic design into `adversarial_validation`; it does not bar defect repair of the Step-4b gate. Recorded as an insight under scope `obpi-pipeline-freeze-scope`.
- Close GHI #765 `fixed` and file the residual rather than hardening in place (verbatim: "Close #765 fixed, file the residual (Recommended)"), on the ground that mandating a receipt raises the bar on every heavy-lane completion and deserves its own ruling. Produced GHI #780.
- Sync after the #778 repair (verbatim: "Sync now (Recommended)").
- Author this handoff and stop rather than continuing to GHI #719 or #747 (verbatim: "Write the handoff and sync (Recommended)").
- Work advised step 1 of the resumed handoff — GHI #719 (verbatim: "Step 1 — work GHI #719"), selected from a four-option picker. Booked via `gz handoff decide`; advised steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 recorded set-aside.
- Proceed on the resumed handoff, working advised steps 1-4 and setting step 5 aside (verbatim: "Rule steps 1–4, then work"). Booked via `gz handoff decide`.
- GHI #747 routes to a pool ADR parked behind ADR-0.35.0, not a direct fix (selected from a three-option picker). The issue self-labels `enhancement` and canon's direct-repair grant covers defects only; a headless OBPI is forbidden and no ADR promised the verb, so pool was the only available home.
- GHI #780 requires the ARB receipt, direct fix (selected from a three-option picker).
- The #780 requirement rides ANY resolved cross-vendor claim, not only a declared tier 1 (verbatim selection: "Any cross-vendor claim"). Ruled after the agent surfaced that the literal scope would have been a no-op fence.
- GHI #779 takes ratchet-plus-widen rather than line-level narration markers or widening alone (selected from a three-option picker).
- GHI #567 disposition: Move 2 as direct doc edits now, Move 1 to a pool ADR, Move 3 declined, then close `superseded` (selected from a four-option picker).
- Sync the five commits and author this handoff (selected from a four-option picker over the close-out).
- Cut patch release v0.34.2 (verbatim: "/gz-patch-release"), then approved the drafted narrative release notes (verbatim: "Approved — execute").
- Work the four-item routing in the order recommended (verbatim: "proceed as suggested"): fix the advise exit code first, then the control-surface chores, then module-SLOC, filing the hardcoded-root GHI alongside the first.
- Re-run the remaining three control-surface chores at full fidelity rather than a shallow pass, and apply the R18/R19 scope fix to governance-core.md (verbatim: "1. yes, 2. yes").
- Stop the SLOC correction after the first module, author a handoff, determine only the chores still failing, and git-sync (verbatim: "stop, write a new handoff, determine only the chores that still need to be passed. git-sync").
- Work all four live advised steps of the resumed anchor (verbatim: "All four steps — 2, 3, 4, 5 in order"), selected from a four-option picker. Advised step 1 was recorded set-aside as already discharged: `origin/main` was 0/0 before the session began.
- GHI #782 takes a fourth option the issue body never listed — delete criterion 6 as redundant with criterion 3 (verbatim selection: "Delete criterion 6 — redundant with criterion 3"). The three arms in the issue all assumed the grep must survive; it did not, because `gz lint` already asserts the property via AST over the identical scope.
- Route the pre-existing `--sensitivity` red to a GHI rather than fixing the brief in-session (verbatim selection: "File a GHI alongside step 5"). The authoring call belongs to `ADR-0.35.0`, whose brief it is.
- Amend the campaign and pull the cross-family critic ahead of `ADR-0.35.0` (verbatim selection: "Amend the campaign — pull the critic now"), after the operator asked verbatim: "what happened to our 2nd opinion work? it is supposed to kick in anytime you invoke AskUserQuestion."
- File a GHI for the inverse-direction gate question rather than building the check immediately or only measuring (verbatim selection: "File a GHI for the inverse-direction check"). Produced GHI #785.
- Sweep all 39 chores for the #782 shape, reporting only, editing nothing (verbatim selection: "Sweep now, report, fix nothing yet").
- Re-run the adversary against the revised critic design before any promotion (verbatim selection: "Re-run the adversary first, then decide"), discharging the ADR's own § Promotion plan item 4.
- Widen the AST detector first, then delete the two remaining greps (verbatim: "widen the AST detector, then delete the two greps"). The ordering is the ruling: deleting first would have dropped the non-subscript coverage the greps uniquely carried.
- Stage the critic's delivery while keeping the pull-ahead (verbatim selection: "Amend to staged delivery, keep the pull-ahead"), on the adversary's `PERFORATED-BUT-NARROWABLE` verdict. The automatic `AskUserQuestion` door ships dark until a calibrated pilot measures false blocks, latency, operator reading time, and decisions changed.
- Record the R4 transport correction in both registers (verbatim selection: "Both — ADR correction and a GHI"). Produced the ADR's § R4 transport correction and GHI #786.
- Author this handoff and sync (verbatim: "yes handoff with git-sync").
- Author a successor handoff prioritizing the newly filed GHIs (verbatim: "write handoff prioritizing these new GHIs - this is whack-a-mole, one step forward, four steps back."). The ordering rationale is recorded in Immediate Next Steps; the churn assessment was tested against measured issue data rather than accepted or dismissed.
- Work all four live advised steps of the resumed anchor (verbatim: "All four steps — 2, 3, 4, 5 in order"), selected from a four-option picker. Advised step 1 was recorded set-aside as already discharged.
- GHI #782 takes a fourth option the issue body never listed — delete criterion 6 as redundant with criterion 3 (verbatim selection: "Delete criterion 6 — redundant with criterion 3").
- Route the pre-existing `--sensitivity` red to a GHI rather than fixing the brief in-session (verbatim selection: "File a GHI alongside step 5").
- Amend the campaign and pull the cross-family critic ahead of `ADR-0.35.0` (verbatim selection: "Amend the campaign — pull the critic now").
- Stage the critic's delivery while keeping the pull-ahead (verbatim selection: "Amend to staged delivery, keep the pull-ahead"), on the adversary's `PERFORATED-BUT-NARROWABLE` verdict.
- Work the resumed handoff in its authored order (verbatim: "Take the handoff's order"), selected from a four-option picker whose alternatives were flipping #786 ahead of #785 on campaign-sequencing grounds, working only the two campaign-critical steps, and holding. Booked via `gz handoff decide`; no step set aside.
- Derive the uncalled-gate population from GHI #744's `data/check_scope_membership.json` out_of_check rather than re-deriving it from VALIDATOR_REGISTRY (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews). The alternatives declined were keeping both registries independent, subsuming everything into one file with widened semantics, and keeping both while only correcting #744's wording. This is the ruling that kept membership single-authority; a second reader would have been free to disagree with the first.
- Finish GHI #785, then file the coupling defect as its own GHI (selected from a four-option picker after the agent surfaced that one gate cost 17 files and the written checklist named 4 of 8). The alternatives declined were finishing #785 only, stopping and reverting, and dropping the derive refactor.
- Fix and close GHI #787 in the same session rather than leaving it in the queue (selected from a four-option picker, after the agent reported the day at net +4 and offered to undo its own contribution). The alternatives declined were also doing #783 at that point, filing nothing further, and parking to reassess the open-count instrument.
- Work GHI #786 next (verbatim: "do 786"), then GHI #783 next (verbatim: "do 783 next").
- Work the resumed handoff's five advised steps after syncing (verbatim: "sync, then all steps."). Booked via `gz handoff decide`; no step set aside.
- Direct-fix the `--distribution` chores-blindness derivation rather than filing, accepting-and-disclosing, or wiring a caller alongside (selected from a four-option picker with rendered previews). This overrode the resumed handoff's own route (a), which the agent had disproved with a fixture probe: regenerating the baseline is a no-op for chores because the regenerator reads the manifest's own keys.
- Fix the predictor when `_expand_includes` was found blind to `packages` (selected from a four-option picker). The alternatives declined were making the `include` list explicit instead, doing both, and stopping to file a GHI. Fixing only the include list would have left the audit's model of the wheel permanently incomplete.
- Record the self-referential scope count and read the six unread domain lists later (selected from a four-option picker). The alternatives declined were reading all six first, building the check now, and filing a GHI without recording. No checker was built.
- Fix the chores delivery gap rather than reverting step 1, excluding the seven files from the baseline, or filing only (selected from a four-option picker). The agent flagged the exclusion arm as the weakest because it would encode a bug as a policy.
- Update the campaign (verbatim: "well, clearly the campaign needs updating. do so please.").
- Leave the authoring of the nine ADR-0.36.0 briefs to the next session (verbatim: "leave the authoring of the briefs to the handoff, git sync after updating the handoff"). The briefs stay draft (scaffold) by ruling, not by oversight.
- Book the resumed anchor `proceed` with all five advised steps set aside, sync only (verbatim: "proceed with the git sync, set aside the rest").
- Work advised step 4, the fork collapse, after reviewing the handoff (verbatim: "review handoff", then "do step 4"). Steps 1, 2, 3 and 5 were not authorized and were not worked.
